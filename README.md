# Annotation Dictation Example Plugin
This is a fairly basic example plugin that attaches a toggle button to the active annotation in a scene, and allows the user to click it and speak to add annotation comments.

# Install
1. Download this repo
2. Extract into your VisRen plugins directory in a folder called "AnnotationDictate"

# Dependencies
This plugin requires the presence of the AzureSpeechToText plugin (which in turn requires an active Azure Speech to Text subscription and valid VisRen Native API key)

# Usage
1. Create or select an annotation
2. Click the floating "D" button
3. Speak. Your speech will be entered as comments on the annotation
4. Click the button again to stop adding comments
